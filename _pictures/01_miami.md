This picture was captured the other day we arrived the US in 2016. We were kind of lost within ourself as we were this away from home for the first time, preparing for a new beginning. Rupesh and I were friends back from Nepal, and were roommates during our grad school at FIU. We had a lot of fun moments together until both of us  graduated in 2022.
