Me and my colleague, Prabin Parajuli investigated the adsorption of different halogens (F2, Cl2, Br2 and I2) on MoS2 monolayer as our M.Sc. dissertation project. We used Density Functional Theory (DFT) with Quantum ESPRESSO suite.
- Studied the semiconducting properties of the system by investigationg the band gap, density of states etc.
