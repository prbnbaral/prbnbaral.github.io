I came across a captivating observation on Prof. Giri Narasimhan's (FIU) website regarding the distinction between a teacher and a guru, and I copied and pasted here:

Difference between a Guru and a Teacher...

- A teacher takes responsibility for your growth. A Guru makes you responsible for your growth.
- A teacher gives you things you do not have and require. A Guru takes away things you have and do not require.
- A teacher answers your questions. A Guru questions your answers.
- A teacher requires obedience and discipline from the pupil. A Guru requires trust and humility from the pupil.
- A teacher clothes you and prepares you for the outer journey. A Guru strips you naked and prepares you for the inner journey.
- A teacher is a guide on the path. A Guru is a pointer to the way.
- A teacher sends you on the road to success. A Guru sends you on the road to freedom.
- A teacher explains the world and its nature to you. A Guru explains yourself and your nature to you.
- A teacher gives you knowledge and boosts your ego. A Guru takes away your knowledge and punctures your ego.
- A teacher instructs you. A Guru constructs you.
- A teacher sharpens your mind. A Guru opens your mind.
- A teacher reaches your mind. A Guru touches your spirit.
- A teacher instructs you on how to solve problems. A Guru shows you how to resolve issues.
- A teacher is a systematic thinker. A Guru is a lateral thinker.
- One can always find a teacher. But a Guru has to find and accept you.
- A teacher leads you by the hand. A Guru leads you by example.
- When a teacher finishes with you, you celebrate. When a Guru finishes with you, life celebrates.
